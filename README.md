# Project Myriad 📖

The definitive, open-source platform for manga and anime enthusiasts to manage, read, watch, and celebrate their collections.

Myriad is an ambitious open-source web application designed to be the ultimate home for your media. It was born from the idea that enthusiasts shouldn't have to juggle multiple apps and services.

## Why Project Myriad?

The current landscape is fragmented. You have one app for local files, another for online reading, and separate websites for tracking and discovery. Project Myriad aims to unify this. Building a project of this scale is only possible with a thriving community.

## ✨ Core Pillars

Myriad is built on four foundational pillars that work in harmony:
- **The Unified Library:** The central nervous system of the entire application. Manage your local files and online sources as one cohesive collection.
- **The Vault (Local Media Engine):** More than just a file list, the Vault is a high-fidelity local library manager. It's built for collectors, providing a powerful, offline-first experience for your media.
- **The Browser (Online Discovery Engine):** Your gateway to the world. The Browser is an extension-based online aggregator, allowing you to browse, read, and watch from various online sources without leaving Myriad.
- **The AI Core:** The brain that powers the "magic." This system will provide intelligent recommendations based on your reading habits and art style preferences, power an advanced semantic search, and more.
- **The Community Layer:** The heart of the project. Connect with other users, share collections, build collaborative guides, and enjoy your hobbies with others.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

We are building Myriad in transparent phases. You can follow our real-time progress on our [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/HeartlessVeteran2/Manga-Web-app-/projects). Our approach is to build a highly useful, stable core first, and then expand.

- [✅] Phase 0: Project Setup & Community Guidelines
- [In Progress] Phase 1: The Core Vault (Local Media MVP)
- [Upcoming] Phase 2: The Browser (Online Source Integration)
- [Upcoming] Phase 3: AI & Community Enhancements
- [Future] Phase 4: Full Anime & Video Integration
