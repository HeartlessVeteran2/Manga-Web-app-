Project Myriad üìñ
The definitive, open-source platform for manga and anime enthusiasts to manage, read, watch, and celebrate their collections.
Myriad is an ambitious open-source web application designed to be the ultimate home for your media. It was born from the idea that enthusiasts shouldn't have to juggle multiple apps and services. It seamlessly merges your local media library with the vast world of online discovery into a single beautiful, intelligent, and community-enriched experience.
Why Project Myriad?
The current landscape is fragmented. You have one app for local files, another for online reading, and separate websites for tracking and discovery. Project Myriad aims to unify this. Building a project of this magnitude is like building a skyscraper: you need a solid blueprint before you lay the first brick. This is that blueprint. We are creating a central headquarters for your entire hobby.
‚ú® Core Pillars
Myriad is built on four foundational pillars that work in harmony:
 * The Unified Library: The central nervous system of the entire application. It's designed to manage your local files and online sources as one cohesive collection.
 * The Vault (Local Media Engine): More than just a file list, the Vault is a high-fidelity local library manager. It's built for collectors, providing a powerful, offline-first experience for your manga (.cbz, .cbr) and anime files.
 * The Browser (Online Discovery Engine): Your gateway to the world. The Browser is an extension-based online aggregator, allowing you to browse, read, and watch from various online sources without leaving the app.
 * The AI Core: The brain that powers the "magic." This system will provide intelligent recommendations based on your reading habits and art style preferences, power an advanced semantic search, and introduce other smart features.
 * The Community Layer: The heart of the project. This pillar will connect users through shared interests, allowing you to share collections, build collaborative guides, and enjoy your hobbies with others.
